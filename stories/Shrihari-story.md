# My Open Source Journey 

 Name: Shrihari  
 First Contribution: October 2024  
 Tools/Tech Used: Git, GitHub, Markdown, VS Code  
 My Experience: I started by fixing a typo in a README during my first Hacktoberfest. That small PR helped me learn git basics and how to follow contribution guidelines. Over time I contributed docs, small bugfixes and later a tiny feature. The community was friendly and reviewers gave constructive feedback which really helped me grow.  
 Advice for Beginners: Start with documentation or small issues, ask politely in PR comments if unsure, and don't be afraid to make your first PR â€” maintainers are usually helpful!
