# My Open Source Journey ✨

👤 **Name:** Soham Padalkar  
📅 **First Contribution:** October 2025  
🔧 **Tools/Tech Used:** Java, Github, Markdown 

🌟 **My Experience:**  
I started my open-source journey during Hacktoberfest 2025. At first, I was nervous about contributing because I thought I needed to be an expert in coding. But then I discovered that many projects welcomed all kinds of contributions—from improving documentation to writing tutorials and designing graphics.

My first push was adding Java’s binary search algorithm to a beginner-friendly repository. Seeing that PR get merged was a game-changer—it gave me the confidence to keep going.


📌 **Advice for Beginners:**  
Don’t wait to be “perfect” at coding. Start small – fix a typo, write a blog, or share your story here. Every contribution matters in open source! 🚀
