# My Open Source Journey ✨

🔧 **Tools/Tech Used:** C++, Python, Flutter, GitHub, Markdown

🌟 **My Experience:**  
I began my open-source journey recently. At first, I was unsure about contributing because I thought I needed to be an expert in programming. But I quickly realized that open source welcomes all kinds of contributions – from fixing typos to improving documentation, creating tutorials, or even designing simple assets.  

My first contribution was small, just a minor fix in a project’s README file – and it got merged! That gave me the confidence to explore more contributions. Since then, I’ve been experimenting with tutorials, code snippets, and small project improvements.  

📌 **Advice for Beginners:**  
Don’t wait to be “perfect” at coding. Start with small contributions, share your ideas, or help improve documentation. Every bit counts in open source! 🚀
