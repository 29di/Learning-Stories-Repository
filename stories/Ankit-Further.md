# My Coding Contribution Journey ðŸ’»

ðŸ‘¤ **Name:** Ankit Kumar Yadav  
ðŸ“… **First Major Contribution:** October 2025  
ðŸ”§ **Tools/Tech Used:** GitHub, Python, Markdown, VS Code, Git  

ðŸŒŸ **My Experience:**  
I started contributing to coding projects after getting comfortable with simple documentation fixes and typo corrections. Moving to actual code contributions was a big leap. The first time I tried to fix a bug in a Python project, I spent hours just understanding the codebase and reading through issues with help of AI.

My initial pull requests were halted, which felt discouraging. But I kept asking questions, reading project guidelines, and learning. Eventually, I managed to submit a working patch that got merged. That moment was a huge confidence boost!

Now, I try to pick up slightly harder issuesâ€”sometimes refactoring code, sometimes adding small features. Each challenge teaches me something new, whether itâ€™s debugging, writing tests, or collaborating with maintainers. The journey is tough, but every accepted PR feels like a win.

ðŸ“Œ **Advice for Beginners:**  
Donâ€™t be afraid to tackle harder problems. Start small, but keep pushing your limits. Ask for help, read the docs, and learn from feedback. Every contribution, big or small, helps you grow as a coder!
