**ðŸŒŸ My Experience:**  
I started my open-source journey during Hacktoberfest. At first, I was nervous about making my first PR, but soon realized that even small contributions like fixing typos or improving documentation are valuable.  
Over time, I learned how to fork repositories, create branches, and collaborate with maintainers.  
The supportive community made me more confident, and now I enjoy contributing regularly.

**ðŸ“Œ Advice for Beginners:**  
Start small â€” documentation and beginner-friendly issues are the best way to begin. Donâ€™t be afraid to ask questions in issues or PRs; most maintainers are happy to help.
