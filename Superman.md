Name: Superman ( Raj Tiwary )
First Contribution: Its Year 2022 That was in Hacktoberfest....
Tools/Tech Used: Python, Git, GitHub  

My Experience:  
I started my open-source journey this year with small Python scripts and DSA practice codes.  
At first, I was nervous about pull requests, but then I realized the community is very welcoming.  
I contributed to a repository by fixing a simple issue and adding my own unique code.  
Through this, I learned how to fork a repo, create branches, and push code properly.  
The best part was seeing my contribution merged â€” it felt like a big achievement.  

Advice for Beginners:  
Donâ€™t wait to be perfect â€” just start small. Even fixing typos or adding simple programs is a valid contribution. ðŸš€

ThankYou....
