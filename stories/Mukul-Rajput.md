#My Open Source Journey âœ¨

ðŸ”§ **Tools/Tech Used**: C++, Git, VS Code, GitHub

ðŸŒŸ **My Experience**:
My open-source journey kicked off during GirlScript Summer of Code (GSSoC) in 2024, a leap I took without fully grasping what open source meant. I stumbled into it, curious and a bit lost, thanks to a friendâ€™s nudge. My first contribution was adjusting the card layouts on a pet websiteâ€”simple tweaks to align images and text better. I was nervous submitting that tiny PR, unsure if itâ€™d even matter. When it merged, I felt a rush of prideâ€”it was my first taste of being part of something bigger, sparking a love for coding thatâ€™s grown ever since.

ðŸ“Œ **Advice for Beginners**:
Donâ€™t expect it to be smoothâ€”I struggled with Git errors and permissions at first. Start small, like I did, and donâ€™t shy away from asking for help when stuck. Every hurdle teaches you something! ðŸš€
