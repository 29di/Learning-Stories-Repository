ðŸŒŸ **My Experience:**

I started my open source journey during Hacktoberfest 2025. I heard about open source contribution for the first time during August, when I heard about Google Summer of Code, but at that time, I didn't have much idea about it. Only recently, I learnt about open source, which I found interesting. I learnt how to use Git and GitHub, cloned a couple of repos from my own account to experiment with it. Just yesterday, my partner asked me to register for Hacktoberfest. I was sceptical at first sice I'm not an expert in coding, that too in real life applications. But then I learnt about non-technical open source contribution, so I decided to give it a try.

My first PR was on a DSA repository where I contributed a few DSA programs in C++, and I'm waiting for it to be merged. I liked the experience, I enjoyed it so much, and I'll contribute more to open source projects.

ðŸ“Œ **Advice for Beginners:**

Open source contribution doesn't means writing fancy code to build a fancy app, even fixing some typo, helping the community and writing small programs contributes to open source. Don't wait until you become an expert. Start contributing now. All the best! Cheers!
