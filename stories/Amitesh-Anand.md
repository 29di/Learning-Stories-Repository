ðŸŒŸ **My Experience:**

My journey began with a clear goal: to prepare for GSoC and apply my Android development skills to a real-world project. I started by searching GitHub for Kotlin projects and found a weather app with a "good first issue." My task was to add a "Last Updated" timestamp, which felt like the perfect first step.

The biggest challenge wasn't writing the code, but understanding an existing codebase and setting up the local environment. After carefully tracing the data flow and learning from the project's existing patterns, I finally got it working. Seeing my PR get merged was a huge confidence boost and proved that I could contribute meaningfully to a community project.

ðŸ“Œ **Advice for Beginners:**

Don't just look for an "easy" issue; find one that genuinely interests you and matches your skills. Reading and understanding the existing code is one of the best ways to learn. Start small, be patient with yourself, and remember that every contribution is a valuable learning experience! ðŸš€
