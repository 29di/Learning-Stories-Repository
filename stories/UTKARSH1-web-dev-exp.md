ðŸŒŸ My Experience:

I began my open-source journey during Hacktoberfest 2024. One of my first contributions was to a project that had a multi-step contribution flow with three pages:

Plan Selection Page â€“ where the client chooses their plan

Review Page â€“ where the selected plan is reviewed

Confirmation Page â€“ to finalize the contribution

The issue I worked on was with the Edit button on the Review Page. When the client clicked "Edit" to go back and change their plan, the form on the Plan Selection Page was resetting and clearing all the previously selected options. This created a frustrating user experience.

To fix this, I explored Angularâ€™s Reactive Forms. Initially, I struggled, but by carefully reading the official documentation and experimenting with different approaches, I was able to implement Reactive Forms correctly. This ensured that the form preserved the previously selected data even when navigating back and forth between pages.

This experience taught me an important lesson: donâ€™t rush to find the solution immediately. First, take the time to understand the problem deeply. Then refer to the documentation and apply it step by step. This approach not only helps you solve the issue effectively but also helps you learn much more in the process.

ðŸ“Œ Advice for Beginners:

Donâ€™t chase solutions blindly. Focus on truly understanding the problem first, then leverage documentation and resources to build the fix. And most importantly, contribute as much as you can â€“ every contribution, no matter how small, helps you grow and learn! ðŸš€
