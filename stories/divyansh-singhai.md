ðŸ“… **First Contribution:** October 2025
ðŸ”§ **Tools/Tech Used:** Python, GitHub, Markdown  

ðŸŒŸ **My Experience:**  
I started my open-source journey during Hacktoberfest 2025. At first, I was nervous, thinking I needed to be an expert to contribute. But then I discovered beginner-friendly projects where even small code fixes or adding simple features made an impact.

My first pull request was fixing a minor bug in a Python script. Seeing my changes work and get merged was an amazing feeling â€“ it gave me the confidence to contribute more. Since then, Iâ€™ve experimented with small features, improved existing scripts, and learned a lot about collaborating with others in open source. 

ðŸ“Œ **Advice for Beginners:**  
Donâ€™t measure your value by the size of your contribution, but by the courage to start. Every small step you take builds skills, confidence, and momentum. Progress comes from persistence, not perfection â€“ and your journey is uniquely yours. ðŸš€
