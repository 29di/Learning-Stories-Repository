# My Open Source Journey âœ¨

ðŸ‘¤ **Name:** Seema Kumari Patel  
ðŸ“… **First Contribution:** 01 October 2025  
ðŸ”§ **Tools/Tech Used:** Python, GitHub, Markdown

ðŸŒŸ **My Experience:**

I'm starting my open-source journey during Hacktoberfest 2025. At first, I felt nervous because I thought I needed to be an expert in coding (ADHD) to contribute. But I soon realized that even small contributions like fixing bugs, improving documentation, or adding beginner-friendly features are highly appreciated too.

My first PR was on a python project where I fixed a compare operator bug â€“ and it got merged! That gave me the confidence to contribute more. Since then, Iâ€™ve contributed to multiple projects, explored different tech stacks, and learned how collaboration works in open-source development.

ðŸ“Œ **Advice for Beginners:**

Donâ€™t wait to be perfect. Start small â€“ fix a typo, improve docs, or contribute to a simple feature. Every contribution helps you learn and grow and glow!! ðŸš€
