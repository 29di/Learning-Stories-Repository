# My Open Source Journey âœ¨

ðŸ‘¤ Name: Ritesh Thakare  
ðŸ“… First Contribution: July 2023  
ðŸ”§ Tools/Tech Used: Python, FastAPI, JavaScript, React.js, GitHub, Git, Docker

ðŸŒŸ My Experience:  
Contributing to open-source taught me the real-world side of software development.  
I started with small bug fixes and documentation improvements, which gave me confidence.  
Later, I explored building APIs, improving performance, and working on scalable systems.  
Collaborating with other developers helped me learn clean coding practices and code reviews.  
Through hackathons and projects, I gained hands-on exposure to rapid prototyping and iteration.  
I also enjoyed contributing to collaborative platforms where my code impacted many developers.  
Open source gave me a community, mentorship, and a sense of building something meaningful.

ðŸ“Œ Advice for Beginners:  
Start small â€” even fixing typos, updating docs, or writing test cases counts as a contribution. Over time, youâ€™ll gain the skills and confidence to take on bigger features. ðŸš€
