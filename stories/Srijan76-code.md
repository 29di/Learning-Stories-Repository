# My Open Source Journey âœ¨

ðŸ‘¤ **Name:** Srijan Patel
ðŸ“… **First Contribution:** 14 December 2024
ðŸ”§ **Tools/Tech Used:** React, JavaScript, Framer

ðŸŒŸ **My Experience:**
I began coding back in 10th grade with Python, which sparked my curiosity about building things with technology. In college, I dove into web development, learning React and modern tools to create interactive projects.

Recently, I stepped into the open-source world and made my first contribution in September 2025. The experience of collaborating, exploring othersâ€™ code, and seeing my PR merged was both exciting and motivating. Open source feels like the perfect space to learn, grow, and share knowledge while building impactful solutions with the community.

ðŸ“Œ **Advice for Beginners:**
Start small and donâ€™t overthink your first contribution. The key is consistency and learning from the process. ðŸš€
