# My open source journey âœ¨

ðŸ‘¤ Name: Ritwik Tat
ðŸ“… First Contribution: August 2023
ðŸ”§ Tools/Tech Used: React.js, Node.js, Express.js,Mongodb, GitHub

ðŸŒŸ My Experience:
I began my open-source journey by contributing to web development and machine learning projects. At first, I felt uncertain because I thought only major code changes would count as contributions. But soon, I realized that even small fixes, documentation improvements, and feature suggestions are valuable.

My first PR was related to fixing frontend responsiveness in a React project, and when it got merged, it boosted my confidence. Since then, Iâ€™ve contributed to both frontend and backend tasks, shared tutorials, and explored machine learning-based open-source initiatives.

ðŸ“Œ Advice for Beginners:
Donâ€™t underestimate the power of small contributions. Start with documentation, fix simple issues, or help in discussions. Over time, youâ€™ll grow into bigger contributions. Consistency is the key to your open-source journey. ðŸš€
