My Experience:

I began my open source journey during Hacktoberfest 2024 with contributions to repositories focused on algorithms and data structures in C++ and Python. Initially, my biggest challenge was understanding Git workflows—handling `git init`, `pull`, `merge conflicts`, and pushing changes to remote branches. Over time, I learned to manage branches properly, squash commits, and follow project contribution guidelines.  

My contributions included adding optimized algorithm implementations, fixing bugs in existing code, and improving documentation for better readability. I also explored GitHub Actions and CI/CD workflows, where I debugged failed pipelines and learned how automated testing ensures code reliability before merging PRs.  

These contributions gave me practical exposure to collaborative software development, version control best practices, and the importance of writing clean, modular, and well-documented code. I also interacted with maintainers and other contributors, which taught me how to communicate effectively in issue discussions, follow coding standards, and review feedback professionally.  

I’m now looking to make more impactful contributions in areas like **Machine Learning, Deep Learning frameworks (JAX/Flax, TensorFlow, PyTorch), and large-scale open source projects (Creative Commons, Mesa, or robotics-related libraries)**. I believe open source is not just about coding—it’s about learning, sharing knowledge, and growing with the community.  

Advice for Beginners: Start with small contributions like fixing typos or improving docs to get comfortable with the workflow. Gradually, move on to solving issues, refactoring code, and adding new features. Always read the `CONTRIBUTING.md` and follow project guidelines—it makes your PRs more likely to be accepted.
