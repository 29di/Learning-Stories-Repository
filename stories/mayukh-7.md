ðŸŒŸ **My Experience:**  
I started my open-source journey during Hacktoberfest 2025. I am currently a 3rd Year Computer Science Engineering student at Brainware University. I am really excited in open source contribution. I recently started my development journey with MERN stack and it feels amazing. I have also participated in hackathons and coding competitions which have helped me in gaining experience. I also practice a lot of Data structures and Algorithms in platforms like leetcode  which have helped me in developing my logic in programming. In my 2 years of experience in college I learned about a lot of tech stacks and platforms which have helped me in becoming a better developer.

ðŸ“Œ **Advice for Beginners:**  
Consistency is very important in coding ðŸš€
