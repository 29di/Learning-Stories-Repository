## 🗺️ The Start of My Journey

I began my open-source journey this year, initially working on small **Python scripts** and **DSA practice codes**. My greatest hurdle was the anxiety surrounding **Pull Requests**; I was nervous about the process and whether my code would be adequate. However, I quickly realized the community is incredibly **welcoming** and supportive. This positive experience was the motivation I needed to push past the initial hesitation.

## 🎯 My First Contribution: Simple Issue Fix

### Contribution Type: Code Fix and New Submission

My first contribution involved fixing a simple issue in a repository and then **submitting my own unique code**. The process was invaluable for learning the essential GitHub workflow:

1.  **Forking** the repository.
2.  **Creating branches** for isolated work.
3.  **Pushing code** properly to my fork.

The most rewarding moment was seeing my contribution **merged** by the maintainers—it felt like a significant achievement and solidified my confidence in contributing again.
