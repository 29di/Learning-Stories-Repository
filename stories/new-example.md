# My Open Source Journey âœ¨

ðŸ‘¤ *Name:* Utkarsh Bajpai  
ðŸ“… *First Contribution:* July 2024  
ðŸ”§ *Tools/Tech Used:* Python, FastAPI, GitHub, Docker  

ðŸŒŸ *My Experience:*  
I began my open-source journey while exploring backend development and cloud tools. At first, I felt overwhelmed seeing huge projects and thought contributions had to be something big. But I soon realized even *small steps like improving README files, refactoring code snippets, or reporting bugs* are valuable.  

My first PR was adding a simple helper function to clean up repetitive code. When it got accepted, it gave me a big boost to continue. Since then, Iâ€™ve worked on improving API documentation, added Docker setup instructions, and shared sample projects that others could build upon.  

ðŸ“Œ *Advice for Beginners:*  
Start with what you know. It doesnâ€™t have to be a major feature â€“ fixing examples, improving documentation, or adding test cases are great entry points. Each small step builds confidence and keeps the communityÂ growing.Â ðŸš€
