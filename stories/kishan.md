# My Open Source Journey âœ¨

ðŸ‘¤ **Name:** Kishan Garhwal
ðŸ“… **First Contribution:** October 2025
ðŸ”§ **Tools/Tech Used:** GitHub, Kotlin, Android Studio, Web Development (HTML, CSS, JS)

ðŸŒŸ **My Experience:**  
I started my open-source journey through college events. At first, I was just helping out on projects made by my seniors, and they guided me a lot. I had registered for Hacktoberfest 2024 too, but back then I was too new and didnâ€™t do any contributions. That actually pushed me to learn more. Now in Hacktoberfest 2025, I finally made my first contribution! I realized open source is not just about writing code, itâ€™s about learning, sharing, and being part of a community.

Since then, Iâ€™ve been trying out more projects and small fixes on my own. It feels nice to see that even little contributions can actually help someone or something.

ðŸ“Œ **Advice for Beginners:**  
Donâ€™t worry about being perfect. Start small, ask for help when you need it, and just keep learning. Every little contribution matters!
