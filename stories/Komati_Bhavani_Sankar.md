# My Open Source Journey âœ¨

ðŸ‘¤ Name: **Bhavani Sankar Komati**  
ðŸ“… First Contribution: **October 2025**  
ðŸ”§ Tools/Tech Used: **Java, C++, Python, GitHub**  

ðŸŒŸ My Experience:  
Contributing to open source for the first time through Hacktoberfest 2025 has been a valuable experience. I made 5 pull requests, and 3 have already been merged. It gave me the chance to understand how collaborative development works, improve my coding practices, and engage with the developer community. The process of reading codebases, understanding issues, and creating solutions helped me sharpen my problem-solving skills. Iâ€™ve also gained confidence in contributing to projects beyond personal work.  

ðŸ“Œ Advice for Beginners:  
Start small, be consistent, and donâ€™t hesitate to ask questionsâ€”the community is always supportive.
