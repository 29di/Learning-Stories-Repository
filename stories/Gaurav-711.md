My Open Source Journey ✨

👤 Name: Gaurav Jha
📅 First Contribution: 2024
🔧 Tools/Tech Used: Python, JavaScript, GitHub, Markdown

🌟 My Experience:

I started my open-source journey while exploring projects during my web development internship and personal projects. At first, it felt a bit overwhelming because I thought only advanced coders could contribute. But soon I learned that open source values all kinds of contributions – from fixing bugs and improving UI to enhancing documentation and adding small but useful features.

My first contribution was improving documentation for a project, and seeing it accepted gave me a big confidence boost. Later, I worked on more technical contributions like building small web apps, fixing issues in JavaScript logic, and learning collaboration through pull requests. Open source taught me not just coding, but also teamwork and problem-solving with real-world impact.

📌 Advice for Beginners:

Don’t wait until you feel “ready.” Start with small contributions like correcting typos, updating docs, or fixing simple bugs. Every small step builds your confidence – and the open-source community is always welcoming! 🚀
