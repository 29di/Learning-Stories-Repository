# My Open Source Journey ✨

👤 **Name:** Jane Doe  
📅 **First Contribution:** October 2023  
🔧 **Tools/Tech Used:** Python, GitHub, Markdown  

🌟 **My Experience:**  
I started my open-source journey during Hacktoberfest 2024. At first, I was nervous about contributing because I thought I needed to be an expert in coding. But then I discovered projects that welcomed like fixing bugs, easy fix, writing tutorials, and such as fixing minor bugs, improving documentation, or adding beginner-friendly features—are just as valuable and appreciated..  

My first PR was fixing a small typo in documentation – and it got merged! That moment gave me the confidence to contribute more. Since then, I’ve shared tutorials, written blogs, and even translated README files into my native language.  

📌 **Advice for Beginners:**  
Don’t wait to be “perfect” at coding. Start small – fix a typo, write a blog, or share your story here. Every contribution matters in open source! 🚀
