ðŸŒŸ **My Experience:**

I started my open-source journey during Hacktoberfest 2024. At first, I felt nervous because I thought I needed to be an expert in coding to contribute. But I soon realized that even small contributions like fixing bugs, improving documentation, or adding beginner-friendly features are highly appreciated.

My first PR was on a React project where I fixed a small UI bug â€“ and it got merged! That gave me the confidence to contribute more. Since then, Iâ€™ve contributed to multiple projects, explored different tech stacks, and learned how collaboration works in open-source development.

ðŸ“Œ **Advice for Beginners:**

Donâ€™t wait to be perfect. Start small â€“ fix a typo, write a simple C code, improve docs, or contribute to a simple feature. Every contribution helps you learn and grow! ðŸš€
