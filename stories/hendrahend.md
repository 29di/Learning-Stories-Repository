# My Open Source Journey âœ¨

ðŸ‘¤ Name: Hendra Hendriana
ðŸ“… First Contribution: October 2023  
ðŸ”§ Tools/Tech Used: JavaScript, HTML, GitHub  
ðŸŒŸ My Experience:  
I started my open source journey through Hacktoberfest. At first, I was a bit confused about the process of forking, cloning, committing, and creating a pull request, but once I tried it, I realized it was actually fun!  
This experience taught me the importance of writing clean and readable code, as well as the value of proper documentation in open source projects.   
Hacktoberfest has motivated me to keep contributing and continue learning from real-world projects.  

ðŸ“Œ Advice for Beginners:  
Donâ€™t be afraid to start â€” even small contributions like fixing typos, adding comments, or building a simple project make a difference ðŸš€
