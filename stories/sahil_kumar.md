My Experience
I have started my open source journey after a lot of tries to be perfect or after waiting for the perfect opportunity,but the truth is neither will there be a perfect moment neither will you ever reach a point without contributing where you can contribute freely without any difficulties it all comes with practice i have wasted my time in this and i advice other to no go down this path.just start with non code contribution if you cannot understand huge codebases and then slowly pick-up "good first issues" and try solving them, joins forums where you are connected with the people working on the same code base and take thier help understanding the code base ,it won't come in a day , it will take time just be consistent.

Advice To beginners:- Just start with even the slighest/smallest contribution no matter what if you can contribute you definately should.
