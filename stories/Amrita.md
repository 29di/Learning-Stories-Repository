# My Open Source Journey ✨

👤 **Name:** Amrita Kumari  
📅 **First Contribution:** October 2025  
🔧 **Tools/Tech Used:** Java, GitHub, DevOps 

🌟 **My Experience:**  
I started my open-source journey during Hacktoberfest 2025 this year .At first, I hesitated to contribute because I assumed only expert coders could make a difference. But soon I realized there are projects that value so much more — from refining documentation and creating tutorials to sharing simple designs. That’s when I found my space to contribute and grow.


I’ve just made my very first pull request — a small typo fix in the documentation. It hasn’t been merged yet, but the experience itself feels like a milestone. Taking this step gave me the confidence to try more, like writing tutorials, blogging, and translating README files into my language.


📌 **Advice for Beginners:**  
Don’t wait to be “perfect” at coding. Start small – fix a typo, write a blog, or share your story here. Every contribution matters in open source! 🚀
