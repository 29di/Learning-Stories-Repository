ðŸŒŸ My Experience:  
I started my open source journey as a first-year B.Tech student specializing in AI & ML.  
I learned how to work with Git and GitHub by contributing to beginner-friendly repositories.  
Over time, I explored various projects like DSA-Code, IPO Insider, and Learning Stories.  
These contributions helped me improve my coding skills, problem-solving abilities, and teamwork.  
I also learned how to write clean, well-documented code and collaborate with others globally.  


ðŸ“Œ Advice for Beginners:  
Start small, donâ€™t hesitate to ask questions, and focus on learning rather than perfection.  
Even a small contribution can make a big difference and boost your confidence!
